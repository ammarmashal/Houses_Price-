# Houses_Price-

My job is to predict the sales price for each house.

In this project, I deal with many things:
1- Skewed Data
2- multicollinearity
3- Outliers


I used professional techniques in building the model :
1- impute multiple models
2- use GridSearchCV to get the best parameters
3- Hyperparameter tuning
